# ShittyLINQ
The shitty version of the LINQ-to-objects Enumerable extension methods for .NET Core.

## What this is  
A collection of extension methods for `IEnumerable<T>`  
This code that was authored while talking about how functions work and what map, filter and foldl do.  
These are not meant to be used by anyone ever.

## What this is not
 - ~~Tested~~ (Tests added 10/3/2017!)
 - Performant
 - [The good version of LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/)

## What's up with the name?  
Earlier today I found out that NPM packages have a ton of Easter eggs and I laughed pretty hard about that.  
This project was originally called ThingsThatArentAggregate_WithAggregate, and ShittyLINQ sounded better when the time came to release this masterpiece.
