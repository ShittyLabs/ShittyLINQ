## What this is  
A collection of extension methods for `IEnumerable<T>`  
This code that was authored while talking about how functions work and what map, filter and foldl do.  
These are not meant to be used by anyone ever.  
This assembly has no dependencies other than Generic Collections.

## What this is not
 - ~~Tested~~ (Tests added 10/3/2017!)
 - Performant
 - [The good version of LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/)

## What's up with the name?  
Earlier today I found out that NPM packages have a ton of Easter eggs and I laughed pretty hard about that.  
This project was originally called ThingsThatArentAggregate_WithAggregate, and ShittyLINQ sounded better when the time came to release this masterpiece.
